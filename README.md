# DSA Practice 

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice code implemented in **Python**.
I‚Äôm using this repo to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen core CS fundamentals, and prepare for technical interviews.

---

* Each folder contains solutions for a specific topic.
* Problems are solved from platforms like **LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, etc.**
* There are Sorting Techniques implementations and solutions to common dsa problems as well.

## üöÄ Goals

* Master **fundamental data structures**: arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, heaps, trees, graphs.
* Practice **important algorithms**: sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking.
* Improve **time & space complexity analysis**.
* Build strong **problem-solving intuition** for coding interviews.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Editor**: VS Code 
* **Platform**: Practice on online judges (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)
